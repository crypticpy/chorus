/**
 * DB seam — barrel re-exports per-table modules.
 *
 * Connection lifecycle (getDb, _resetDbForTests, resolveDbPath) lives in
 * connection.ts; each table has its own file with schema + ops.
 *
 * Rollback lever for the libsql migration: the v0.7 swap from
 * better-sqlite3 was a clean transport change. If a hot-path perf
 * regression turns up in production, the rollback is a clean revert
 * (NOT a swap to the sync `libsql` package — its API would require
 * unwinding every `await` in this layer and its callers).
